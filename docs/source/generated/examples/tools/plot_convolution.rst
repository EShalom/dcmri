=====================================
A comparison of convolution functions

Using the convolution functions `~dcmri.conv`, `~dcmri.expconv`, `~dcmri.biexpconv` and `~dcmri.nexpconv`.

Generate two normalized gaussian distributions f(t) and h(t) and use `~dcmri.conv` to convolve them. Compare the result to `numpy.convolve`:

    t = np.linspace(0, 100, 50)
    f = norm.pdf(t, 30, 5)

While there is clearly some relation between both results, they are not in any way similar. The `~numpy.convolve` result is shifted compared to `~dcmri.conv` and has a lower amplitude. This shows that caution is needed when applying convolution formulae from different libraries in a tracer-kinetic setting.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 36-37

In the special case where one of the factors is an exponential function, the function `~dcmri.expconv` is more accurate than `~dcmri.conv`, though the difference is small at this time resolution:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-49

.. code-block:: Python

    Tf = 20
    f = np.exp(-t/Tf)/Tf
    g0 = dc.conv(h, f, t)
    g1 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
    plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
    plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')
    plt.plot(t, g0, 'k-', label='conv()')
    plt.plot(t, g1, color='gray', linestyle='-', label='expconv()')
    plt.title('Comparison of conv() and expconv()')

    plt.show()

However, `~dcmri.expconv` comes with a major improvement in computation time compared to `~dcmri.conv`, showing the that `~dcmri.expconv` should be used whenever applicable. We illustrate the effect by applying the functions 500 times and measuring the total computation time in each case:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-60

.. code-block:: Python

    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(500):
        dc.conv(h, f, t)
    print('Computation time for conv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')
    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(500):
        dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
    print('Computation time for expconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Computation time for conv():  5.179182052612305 sec
    Computation time for expconv():  0.01562190055847168 sec




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 61-62

Incidentally since the time array in this case is uniform, `~dcmri.conv` can be accelerated by specifying dt instead of t in the arguments. However the performance remains far below `~dcmri.expconv`:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-67

.. code-block:: Python

    start = time.time()
    for i in range(500):
        dc.conv(h, f, dt=t[1])
    print('Computation time for conv() with uniform times: ', time.time()-start, 'sec')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Computation time for conv() with uniform times:  1.8759734630584717 sec




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 68-69

The difference in accuracy between `~dcmri.conv` and `~dcmri.expconv` becomes more apparent at lower temporal resolution but generally remains minor. Using 10 time points instead of 50 as above we start seeing some effect:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-82

.. code-block:: Python

    t = np.linspace(0, 120, 10)
    h = norm.pdf(t, 60, 10)
    f = np.exp(-t/Tf)/Tf
    g0 = dc.conv(h, f, t)
    g1 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
    plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
    plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')
    plt.plot(t, g0, 'k-', label='conv()')
    plt.plot(t, g1, color='gray', linestyle='-', label='expconv()')
    plt.title('Comparison of conv() and expconv() at lower resolution')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

If both functions are exponentials, convolution can be accelerated further with `~dcmri.biexpconv`, which uses an analytical formula to calculate the convolution: 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 84-94

.. code-block:: Python

    Th = 10
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(1000):
        dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
    print('Computation time for expconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(1000):
        dc.biexpconv(Th, Tf, t)
    print('Computation time for biexpconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

    Computation time for biexpconv():  0.0 sec




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-96

Using an analytical formula also comes with some improvements in accuracy, which is apparent at lower time resolution:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 96-107

.. code-block:: Python

    h = np.exp(-t/Th)/Th
    g0 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
    g1 = dc.biexpconv(Th, Tf, t)

The final convolution function `~dcmri.nexpconv` convolves n indentical exponentials with mean transit time T analytically. We illustrate the result by keeping the total mean transit time MTT=nT constant, and increasing n from 1 to 100:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-121

.. code-block:: Python

    MTT = 30
    t = np.linspace(0, 120, 500)
    g1 = dc.nexpconv(1, MTT/1, t)
    g10 = dc.nexpconv(10, MTT/10, t)
    g100 = dc.nexpconv(100, MTT/100, t)
    plt.plot(t, g1, 'r-', label='1 exponential')
    plt.plot(t, g10, 'g-', label='10 exponentials')
    plt.plot(t, g100, 'b-', label='100 exponentials')
    plt.title('Convolutions of identical gaussian distributions')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-123

As the number of exponentials increases, the convolution converges to a delta function positioned on t=MTT. This is because the system models a bolus transit through n identical compartments, which become increasing smaller at higher n and thus allow less bolus dispersion. A system like this is referred to as a chain in `~dcmri` which has the compartment (n=1) and the plug flow system (n=infty) as special cases.
